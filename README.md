## The Problem

Hundreds of people — mostly children — go missing every day in India. When a sighting is reported, officers have to manually compare photos, sift through paperwork, and coordinate across stations. By the time a match is confirmed, the trail has often gone cold.

---

## A Case, Start to Finish

**Step 1 — Family files a report. Officer registers the case.**

A family in Haridwar reports their child missing. An officer opens the portal, uploads a photo, and the AI immediately detects the face and extracts a 468-point mesh — no manual tagging needed.

---

**Step 2 — The dashboard tracks every open case.**

The officer's home screen shows live counts of found and not-found cases, and a map that plots where cases are concentrated across India.

---

**Step 3 — A member of the public submits a sighting.**

Someone recognises the person and submits a photo through the public portal (no login required). The same face mesh is extracted and stored.

When an admin clicks **Match Cases**, the KNN model compares all sightings against all open cases. If a face is close enough, the case is automatically flipped to **Found** and the complainant is notified by email.

---

**Step 4 — The city map tells the bigger picture.**

Admins can see which cities have the most unresolved cases and track resolution rates over time.

---

## How It Works

1. **Officer registers a case** → uploads a photo → AI extracts a 468-point face mesh
2. **Public submits a sighting** → uploads a photo or video → same extraction
3. **Admin clicks Refresh** → KNN matches faces across both datasets → email sent to complainant on match

No manual photo comparison. No paperwork pile-up.

## Features

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| Face detection | MediaPipe Face Landmarker — highlights detected faces, handles multiple people in frame |
| AI matching | KNN on 1,404-dimensional face vectors; shows confidence % |
| Video sightings | Upload a video — unique faces extracted automatically per frame |
| Live map | Dashboard map showing case density by city across India |
| Email alerts | Auto-notifies complainant email when a match is confirmed |
| Role-based access | Admins can match, edit, delete; Officers can register and view |
| Public portal | Separate mobile-friendly submission page, no login needed |

---

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaganmanku96/Finding-missing-person-using-AI.git
cd Finding-missing-person-using-AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the officer/admin portal:
```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

Run the public submission portal:
```bash
streamlit run mobile_app.py
```

The SQLite database and face landmarker model (~30 MB, auto-downloaded on first use) are created automatically.

### Optional: Email notifications

Set these environment variables to enable email alerts on match:
```
SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWORD
```
The complainant's email entered during case registration is used as the recipient.

## Configuring Login Credentials

Credentials are stored in `login_config.yml`. To add or change a user:

**1. Generate a bcrypt password hash:**
```python
import bcrypt
print(bcrypt.hashpw(b"your_password", bcrypt.gensalt()).decode())
```

**2. Edit `login_config.yml`:**
```yaml
credentials:
  usernames:
    your_username:               # used as the login username
      name: Your Display Name
      email: you@example.com
      city: Delhi
      area: Sector 1
      role: Admin                # Admin or Officer
      password: '$2b$12$...'     # paste the hash from step 1
```

**Roles:**
| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| Admin | Register cases, view all cases, trigger matching, edit/delete cases |
| Officer | Register cases, view own cases |

> `login_config.yml` is git-ignored by default. Never commit real credentials.

## Seeding Demo Data

The `scripts/` folder contains two utilities for populating the database with demo data.

### Step 1 — Download sample images

```bash
# Download ~2 images per celebrity into scripts/bulk_data/reported/
uv run scripts/download_celebrity_images.py --dest reported

# Or split across both folders (reported + publicly_seen)
uv run scripts/download_celebrity_images.py --dest both
```

This uses DuckDuckGo image search — no API key needed.

You can also drop your own images directly into:
```
scripts/bulk_data/reported/        ← missing person cases
scripts/bulk_data/publicly_seen/   ← public sighting submissions
```

### Step 2 — Run the bulk upload

```bash
python scripts/bulk_upload.py
```

This processes every image in both folders:
- Extracts a face mesh using MediaPipe (images with no detectable face are skipped)
- Generates realistic metadata (names, cities, Aadhaar numbers, last-seen locations)
- Inserts records into the SQLite database
- Copies images to `resources/` so the app can display them

By default `submitted_by` is set to `gagan` (the username in the default `login_config.yml`). If you've changed your username, pass it explicitly:

```bash
python scripts/bulk_upload.py --officer your_username
```

To reset and re-seed from scratch:
```bash
sqlite3 sqlite_database.db "DELETE FROM registeredcases; DELETE FROM publicsubmissions;"
python scripts/bulk_upload.py
```

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit** — UI for both portals
- **MediaPipe Tasks** — face mesh landmark extraction (468 points × 3D)
- **scikit-learn KNN** — face matching
- **SQLModel + SQLite** — data storage
- **Folium** — interactive map
- **OpenCV** — video frame extraction

## FAQ

**Q: Can I run this without an internet connection?**
The face landmarker model (~30 MB) is downloaded once on first run and cached locally. After that, both portals work fully offline.

**Q: How accurate is the face matching?**
Accuracy depends heavily on photo quality. Front-facing, well-lit photos work best. The confidence score shown on each match reflects KNN distance — higher is a stronger match.

**Q: Can I add multiple officers?**
Yes. Add as many usernames as needed to `login_config.yml`. Each officer sees only their own registered cases; Admins see all cases.

**Q: The map doesn't show a city I entered.**
The map uses a built-in city → coordinates lookup. If a city is missing, open an issue or add it to the `CITY_COORDS` dict in `Home.py`.

**Q: Where is the data stored?**
Everything is in `sqlite_database.db` (git-ignored) in the project root. Images are stored as JPGs in `resources/` (also git-ignored). Nothing is sent to any external server.

**Q: How do I reset the database?**
```bash
sqlite3 sqlite_database.db "DELETE FROM registeredcases; DELETE FROM publicsubmissions;"
```
Or simply delete `sqlite_database.db` — it will be recreated on next run.

**Q: Can the public portal be hosted separately from the officer portal?**
Yes. They are independent Streamlit apps (`Home.py` and `mobile_app.py`) and share only the SQLite database. Point both to the same database file path and they will work together.
